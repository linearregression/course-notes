# Machine learning
Statistics vs machine learning
* stats try to model the world through a stochastic process
* ML discards accuracy of the model in favor of accuracy of prediction 
[ strong vs weak AI ]

Classification vs regression (discrete classes vs numeric ranges)
Supervised vs unsupervised learning

Learning components:
* representation (what is the classifier?)
* evaluation (is it good or bad, and how do we know?)
* optimization (how do you search among the alternatives?)
