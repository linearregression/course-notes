# Visualization
Targeting information visualizations
More efficient understanding of complex data
Graphs reveal patterns that data may not

# Data types
* Nominal (labels)
* Ordinal (ordered)
* Quant / interval (loc of zero arbitrary)
* Quant / ratio (zero is fixed)

Mapping data types
key attributes, in decreasing accuracy (towards nominality)
* position
* size
* value
* texture
* color
* orientation
* shape

Each is appropriate for some data types

# Data dimensions
Univariate data - lots of options
increasing dimensions = fewer options, and many aren't very good

# Visual encoding
1. encode the most important data in the most accurate way
2. depict all and only the data (color *cannot* represent ordinal data)
3. the properties of the image should match the data (1d data should not be represented in a 2- or 3d chart)

Effectiveness:
* faster to interpret
* more distinctions
* fewer errors

Increasing info encoded by position
* composition
* alignment (repitition)
* folding
* recursion
* overloading

# Visual perception
Eye mechanics - they are *not* cameras
Attention is selective

Preattentive processing - basic visual properties that "pop out" at you
* color
* form / shape
* orientation
* length
* ...  lots of others

Magnitude estimates
* length is goodish
* area is underestimated
* volume is even worse

use *apparent* magnitude; another continuum of traits where we show decreasing accuracy

# Evaluation
* Purpose / audience
* initial reaction
* detail
* aesthetics
* understandable?
* adds value?
* better than alternatives?
* reveal trends?
* highlight important info?
* distort info?
* omit info?
* memorable?
* use visual components correctly?
* use labels appropriately?
