# What is design?
What are artifacts? human-made objects, definitionally. We'll be using it broader (not just concrete/physical objects -- include software, processes, etc.)
Design is the creation of artifacts

Ex: ice cream scoops
I've got this great stuff, need a way to serve it, existing objects are inadequate == the gap that design is meant to solve

[ this guy would be a really interesting keynoter at RailsConf ]

Design is conceiving and giving form to artifacts that solve problems
Process: gap is experienced, design produces a plan, the plan is executed to produce an artifact that is then tested against the gap

Scott Kim, inversions graphics -- are they design? Not according to this definition (most likely art rather than design, but the methodology/aesthetic could be design based on gaps experienced)

# Course logistics
Three types of assignments
* weekly, actual design work on course project
* periodic non-course project assignments
* visual expression - thumbnail sketches & more refined illustrations

Peer evaluation for assignments

# Design process
Gap =design=> plan =production=> artifact
Presenting *a* design process based on PDCA cycle (plan / do / check / act):
1. sense the gap
2. define the problem - identify essential elements of the gap (ergonomic, sanitation, aesthetics, cost, etc.)
3. explore alternatives - divergent exploration of all possibilities
4. select plan - converge on a solution

# Iteration
Design is fundamentally iterative; exploration of solutions increases clarity in problem definition; selecting a plan can help generate new alternatives
Steps 2, 3, and 4 can overlap

Scales of iteration
* within a project, individual designer
* over multiple implementations of an artifact
* over multiple generations of a type of artifact

# Find the gap
Course project criteria:
* the designer feels the pain him or herself
* access to at least five other people with the same pain point
* simple enough problem for an eight-week course
* a problem that can be addressed by pre-existing skills
