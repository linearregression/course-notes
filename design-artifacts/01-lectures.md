# What is design?
What are artifacts? human-made objects, definitionally. We'll be using it broader (not just concrete/physical objects -- include software, processes, etc.)
Design is the creation of artifacts

Ex: ice cream scoops
I've got this great stuff, need a way to serve it, existing objects are inadequate == the gap that design is meant to solve

[ this guy would be a really interesting keynoter at RailsConf ]

Design is conceiving and giving form to artifacts that solve problems
Process: gap is experienced, design produces a plan, the plan is executed to produce an artifact that is then tested against the gap

Scott Kim, inversions graphics -- are they design? Not according to this definition (most likely art rather than design, but the methodology/aesthetic could be design based on gaps experienced)
