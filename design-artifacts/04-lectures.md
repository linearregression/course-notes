# Concept selection
Start with many concepts, and narrow them down to the "best" option
Moving from creation-work to analysis-work (right brain v left brain, pfft)

Desirable traits of a selection method:
* you get the right answer
* transparency - the logic behind the method is accessible
* self-documenting

# Concept selection matrix
Columns of the matrix = concepts under evaluation
Rows of the matrix = criteria (key needs + cost, wow!, and elegance/beauty)
Cells: evaluate each concept against each criterion
* + for the best, - for the worst, and checkmark (or 0) for average/midpoint
* sum +'s, -'s, and 0's for the results

# Concept scoring matrix
Selection matrix: weighted criteria and a more granular scale
May be overkill

# Prototyping
Prototype: an approximation of the artifact on one or more dimensions of interest
Successive prototypes can improve the approximation

Distribute prototypes to alpha testers, continue to refine

# Focused v comprehensive; analytical v physical
Partial approximations
* focused on one or a few dimensions vs. comprehensive, approximating the final product on all dimensions
* physical and analytical prototypes - digital illustration tools to design a room, etc.

# Prototype uses
Build prototypes to:
* answer questions - address "will it work?" and "will they like it?"
* communicate - communicate design concepts to others
* provide milestones on the way to production - proof of concept, alpha, beta, preproduction

The "ideal point" model - everyone has a point in the design space where they are maximally satisfied
