# Concept selection
Start with many concepts, and narrow them down to the "best" option
Moving from creation-work to analysis-work (right brain v left brain, pfft)

Desirable traits of a selection method:
* you get the right answer
* transparency - the logic behind the method is accessible
* self-documenting
