# Concept selection
Start with many concepts, and narrow them down to the "best" option
Moving from creation-work to analysis-work (right brain v left brain, pfft)

Desirable traits of a selection method:
* you get the right answer
* transparency - the logic behind the method is accessible
* self-documenting

# Concept selection matrix
Columns of the matrix = concepts under evaluation
Rows of the matrix = criteria (key needs + cost, wow!, and elegance/beauty)
Cells: evaluate each concept against each criterion
* + for the best, - for the worst, and checkmark (or 0) for average/midpoint
* sum +'s, -'s, and 0's for the results
