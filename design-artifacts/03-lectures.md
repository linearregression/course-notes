# Intro to exploring for design concepts
Concept = visual description of a potential solution, usually a sketch
Great concepts are motivated by:
* user needs
* cost (original Glide packaging)
* wow factor (potentially patentable, but definitely gives you something to create customer evangelists)
* aesthetics & beauty

How do we accomplish that? Generate a lot of options
Concept exploration is *hard*, it's not just a matter of working hard (luck enters in - ideas can come from anywhere), and it's iterative

# Exploration as an individual or a group
Group design => brainstorming (team generation of ideas) is suboptimal
Better to explore as individuals and reconvene to evaluate

Guidelines for group design:
* use a hybrid process (individual exploration + group phase)
* provide a numerical target for the individual phase (e.g., 10 ideas)
* call a meeting but have people work alone (if people aren't doing the work)

# Getting physical
Design for physical goods almost *necessarily* means you need to experiment with physical objects

# Decomposition: decomposing by user need
Decomposition = take a big design problem, carve it into subproblems
1. divide into subproblems (key/latent needs, sequence, function)
2. solve the subproblems with concepts
3. integrate the solutions

Decomposing by key/latent needs

# Decomposing by sequence
Esp useful for service design problems
Identify sequence of steps
Ex: car rental = shop > booking > pick-up > use > drop-off

Improve each step, combine the improvements

# Decomposing by function
Create function diagram - flow chart of materials, energy, and signal for the artifact
Ex: ice cream = bulk container -divide-> chunk -form ball-> ball (material)

Pick a couple of functions to focus on; generate concepts for those functions independent of the larger problem
then combine them

# Competitive artifacts
Look at alternatives that are already available
Evaluate the tradeoffs they made
Make sure you explore *first*, or you risk anchoring to existing artifacts

# Scoop: 10 concepts
Looking at the process through the ice cream scoop example

# Visual expression III: two-point perspective
One-point perspective: all lines converge on a single point; two (e.g., vertical) lines are parallel
Two-point perspective: lines converge on two points; vertical lines are actually vertical
Three-point perspective: lines converge on three points

Worm's eye view: looking up
Street level: looking straight
Bird's eye view: looking down
