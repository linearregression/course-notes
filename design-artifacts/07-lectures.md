# Brands
1. Brands are integrally connected to artifacts
2. Brands themselves are artifacts

Brands identify the source of an artifact
They also:
* reduce search costs for a consumer
* are attributes of artifacts that carry potentially-useful information (e.g., prestige)
* allow association with desirable traits that aren't honest signals (e.g., Patagonia for couch potatoes)

# Brand names
Great names:
1. evocative (Bugasalt = assaults bugs) of what it is
2. positive associations (drug names)
3. easy to say
4. easy to remember (dictionary words are easier than made-up words; shorter words are easier)
5. easily- and unambiguously-spellable
6. legally and practically available (domain names)

# Design process for brand names
Standard process for design, just applied to brand names
* naming just a product or also an organization?
* do you need a domain name?
* what attributes are you trying to evoke?
* all the attributes of great names, above

Exploration - decomposition, generate chunks and combine them in interesting ways
* dictionary words
* proper nouns
* other roots
* affixes

Manipulation:
* use directly
* combine
* mutate
* affixes
