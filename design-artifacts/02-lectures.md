# Problem statement
Problem definition, part 1: creating a single statement to clarify the scope of the problem
Be intentional about the specificity / generality of the statement

The five whys:
* why would we want to solve that problem? why that? etc.
* generalization tool

The hows:
* specification tool

Whys + hows => hierarchy from most specific to general, with the problem statement somewhere in the middle

Start with the initial conception; follow up with whys and hows
Then locate the problem statement at a level that you can make a measurable impact while still keeping a range of possibilities

# User vs. expert designers
Separation between designers and users:
1. Not every user has the expertise to design products for use
2. Economies of scale / production - need to understand needs for a large population of users

# Importance of user needs
Part two of problem definition: identifying user needs
Designer's goal: creating customer evangelists
Best way to do that: identify, anticipate, and meet user needs
There can be 30-400 distinct user needs for a given product

# Types of user needs
User needs: characteristics or qualities that, when present, close the gap and satisfy the user
* Not all users value every user need
* User needs can be contradictory
* User needs can be prioritized
* User needs can be categorized - the Kano framework (customer satisfaction vs. extent to which the need is satisfied; don't care, linear needs, must haves, and latent needs have different curves within the framework)
  * must-haves piss people off when absent, don't add joy when present
  * latents aren't missed, but make people very happy when present
* User needs may be at different levels of abstraction - possibly cluster the list under more abstract needs

There are empirical and analytical methods for categorizing, prioritizing, and analyzing user needs, but they aren't commonly used

# Gathering data on needs
Problem definition:
1. Articulate problem statement
2. Identify user needs

Steps to identifying user needs
1. Connect with users
  * Observation
  * Interviews
2. Collect raw data
3. Code the data into *needs statements*
4. Flag the latent needs
5. (Prioritize the needs)

Who do you connect with, and how? 
* segments (professional vs. hobbyist, etc.)
* individuals can sway things badly (e.g., if you talk to a weirdo)

Focus groups are less effective per-hour than one-on-one interviews
* prefer one-on-one interviews
* # of new needs identified shows diminishing returns - minimum of 10 users/segment should give ~95% of needs for that segment (5 users => !80%)

## Passive observation / fly on the wall
Look for
* awkward actions
* homemade solutions
* signs / post-its
* visible frustration
* inefficiencies
* errors
(most useful for dealing with existing problems / solutions)

## Interviews
Interview in the user environment when possible
Open-ended discussion with prompts as needed
Techniques:
* show me ...
* why did you choose X?
* what do you like / dislike about X?
* how could it be better?
* what did you consider when choosing X?
Observe non-verbal information

# Method for coding needs
1. Needs statements are as *specific* as the raw data
2. Express needs without implying a design concept (avoid the how)
3. Express needs as an attribute of the artifact to be designed (similar to avoiding the passive voice)
4. Avoid the words *must* and *should* (premature prioritization)

* Arrange needs hierarchically (prefer organically-generated category headers)
* Flag the latent needs (mark with a "!")

# Visual expression: orthographic projection and cross-sections
Orthographic projection: a flattened, 2d view of a 3d object
* top, front, and side views of a 3d object (total: six views - top, bottom, side A, side B, front, and back)
* usually organized corresponding to the view (top view on top, side view next to front view)
* relatively easy
* unambiguously describes geometry
* use boxes and guidelines to ensure scale, alignment, etc.

Cross-sections - internal views of a 3d object
