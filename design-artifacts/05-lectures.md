# Concept testing
How do you know that you're actually closing the gap?
Test with users (unless you're dogfooding)

Purchase intent survey
* sample representative users
* ask if they'd buy the concept (image, description)
* problem: the image and description may not actually convey the correct impression
* tradeoff: get info earlier but info is less valuable with less concrete artifacts
* some artifacts are more amenable to verbal vs. concrete descriptions

Forced choice
* given several options/concepts, which would you choose?
* can include new concepts and existing solutions

Forecasting:
Total units sold per year * fraction of market aware of the product * fraction of survey respondents selecting the concept * factor to account for stated vs. actual behavior

Forecasts are inaccurate but predictive

# Innovation tournaments
Innovation is "a new match between a solution and a need"
Design can be innovations, but it's a subset (e.g., discovery of teflon wasn't design but was innovation)

Tournament
* many initial options, successive filters to transform raw opportunities to exceptional opportunities
* used for lots of domains (design, singing, graphic design, pharmacology, apparel, etc.)
