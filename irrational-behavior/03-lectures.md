Cost-benefit analysis of dishonesty is the norm, and it's wrong

# The simple model of rational crime
We lie, cheat, etc. a little constantly, but we think of ourselves as moral regardless. Why?

Why did Enron collapse? A few bad people, or lots of people turning a blind eye (being a little bad) to worse things?
John Perry Barlow "created an ideology that protected him from seeing the truth"

How do we measure cheating? the matrix test 
people solve 4, report 6 (when they think it's not being validated) - few egregious cheaters
Gary Becker, rational theory of cheating - cost/benefit analysis
* benefit
* prob of capture
* punishment

Experiments:
1. increase payout, observe cheating => no increase in cheating (but people think other people would cheat more)
2. manipulate prob of capture => no change in cheating (but people think other people would cheat more)
3. manipulate expectation of performance ("most people solve 4/8") => no change in cheating

Rational theory appears disproven; need a new theory

# Shrinking and expanding the fudge factor
Fudge factor theory: balance of self-image (I'm a good person) and economic incentive (benefit of cheating)

Fudge factor shrinking experiments:
1. Prime on 10 commandments => no cheating (any thinking about morality)
2. Honor code => no cheating (even though neither location had an honor code)
3. Two weeks after Princeton honor code => no sign, cheating; sign, no cheating (training had no long-term effect)

[ intervention at time of action vs. pre-emptive intervention -- the former can be more effective ]

4. Sign honor code after action => cheating (signature can prime morality OR validate accuracy)

Insurance: few outright frauds, but lots of exaggeration on actual claims

5. Sign mileage form before or after => less cheating

Fudge factor expanding experiments:
1. Cokes in fridges => 72 hours gone
2. Money in fridges => no one takes it
3. Matrix test with direct money vs. tokens => more cheating (cashless society makes this super worrisome)

Provide examples of cheating
4. Prepaid + acting student => more cheating

cost/benefit analysis vs. social proof
5. "Can't I just say I solved everything and go?" without the example => less cheating (morality priming)
6. Sweatshirt => more cheating for in-group, less for out-group

Personality traits and cheating
Are creative people better at fudging (rationalization ==> storytelling)?
7. More creative people => more cheating
8. Increase creativity => more cheating by same person
9. Advertising agency => cheating corresponded to job role's requirement of creativity

Rationalization == cheating

Small cheating in large volumes is way worse than big cheaters

# Conflicts of interest
We act on bias all the time
Conflicts of interest are rampant, but we know that they damage decisions
Does disclosure of CoI work?

Experiments:
1. advisor / advisee; advisor acts on CoI. +sunshine policy, advisee discounts insufficiently, advisor exaggerates *more* (sunshine policy made it *worse*)

Dan's shaving tattoo story
Our own interests blind us to others'
Dan: throw out the outlier? if he'd been in the other group, we wouldn't have thrown him out
Rules to protect against ourselves

[ stop rationalizing dishonest behavior ]

CoI operate within the fudge factor

Art from gallery => like art from the sponsored gallery more, and the *brain did the same*
CoI => we feel indebted, which changes how the brain works

Financial crisis:
Direct benefit (bonus), steps from money (spreadsheets), social proof (everyone valuing mortgages highly), creativity (rationalization)

# Cheating over time and across cultures
What about multiple chances to cheat over time?
Dot experiment - paid more when you answer "right side" (medical analogy)
People start to cheat a bit, then switch and cheat *all the time*
Possible answer: what the hell, why not? (diet, screw it)

How do we reset the fudge factor to prevent "what the hell"?
Catholic confession: it doesn't increase cheating (despite what economists would think)
* rational theory => increases cost of dishonesty. meh.
* morality priming => too short-lived?
* reset fudge factor

Experiments:
1. cheat a little -> cheat a lot -> confess -> ask forgiveness -> temporary cheating decline

Reconciliation act after apartheid

Cultural differences?
US == Israel == Italy == Turkey == England == Canada
How do we reconcile reality with expectations?
These experiments are basically cultureless (matrix test), so they're testing basic moral flexibility. Culture influences morality in a specific domain (e.g., plagiarism, infidelity)
One experiment that shows cross-cultural differences: bars, 4 questions/beer. DC congressional staffers vs. NYC bankers. Bankers cheated more!
