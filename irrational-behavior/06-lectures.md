# Two systems
Pascal - "We arrive at truth, not by reason alone, but also by the heart"
Limbic system (emotion) and cognitive system (rationality)
Emotions override executive function / rationality (flee the tiger) -- almost reflexive, in that it takes an input and fires a response without thought
Qualia: internal and subjective aspect of sense experience

Emotions are transient and shorter-lived than we usually expect
Affective forecasting: I'll be very happy/sad for a very long time, when in reality they regress to their average very quickly

Emotions override cognition
Tested with sexual arousal, effects on:
1. sexual preferences
2. willingness to take risks
3. willingness to commit immoral acts

Control group: unaroused
1. no kinks
2. always practice safe sex
3. no immorality

Aroused group (shown porn, self-stimulation to 75% of arousal):
1. every kink was more exciting
2. much riskier
3. more immoral

==> predictions made in the cold state about our hot preferences/behaviors are pretty much useless
Abstinence pledge-takers have very high rates of STDs (they predict they can resist, then are caught without a condom and succumb)
This is *not* exculpatory

# Intra-empathy mismatch
The difference between predictions about behavior when emotional and the reality (and vice versa)
People say they want to watch classy movies, but they pick lower-class movies at movie-picking time
When gym-goers became thirsty, they became more interested in helping water-related causes
Charity dinners would be better if they were forced to wait for the food -- empathy for the hungry poor

# Identifiable victim effect
Trolley problem: kill 4 people or kill 1 person with a switch vs. pushing the backpacker off the bridge
[ discounting the murder / letting die / being instrument of death? ]
Discrepancy between cognitive and emotional thinking

money donated by number of people affected: negative correlation (malaria gets a fraction of the money spent around Katrina)
- some effects affect people you know / could have been you => we're more willing to donate
- also: prevention vs. rescue

IVE: we care more about suffering when it is represented by one individual

Test abstract (millions of starving kids) vs. concrete (give money to help Rokia) -- double the money to Rokia
immediate, obvious need (save the baby in the water) vs. distant, time-separated need (starving kids in Africa)
ALSO: adding statistical info to Rokia => lower donations (!!)
emotion + cognition is less effective than emotion alone
priming computation decreases empathy
positive effect: caring about people / empathy overriding rational self-interest makes better society

Test eight kids: donate to one kid randomly selected after giving vs. before giving => selecting before increases giving
Seeing concrete examples make tragedies real to us (Haiti; mad cow and the calf)

Use this research to get people to care and donate more effectively

# Emotional decision making
Baby Jessica - more coverage than Rwanda and Darfur combined
Spammers are trying to create an emotional link (Nigerian prince)
- poor grammar => possibly intentional, to hook the most gullible marks (discard the more suspicious people)
- large test groups, lots of potential human behavior research

Emotion vs. cognition
decide on jam/poster -- just on emotion or with cognitive influence
- emotionals used more of the product; lack of cognition increases pleasure for emotional-consumption
- consumption experience should match decision environment for maximum pleasure

stereo speakers
- in store, you compare sounds, so tiny differences seem more important
- at home, no comparison on sound, so appearance becomes more important

# Risk assessment
Judge odds of death from various circumstances
- we overestimate causes of death that we've seen / heard most recently (shark attack vs. killed by falling airplane parts)
- salience of emotion

death from car crashes = 400x death from international terrorism
- under our control (car) vs. out of our control (terrorism)

Perception of risk rises when:
- event is salient in memory
- we have an emotional response

Not all emotions are the same strength (arousal, anger vs. empathy, emotion triggered by a book)

Emotions are 
- a basic component of human nature
- capable of overcoming cognition
- able to work for us or against us
