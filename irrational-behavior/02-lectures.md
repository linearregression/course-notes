# 2.1 Opportunity cost
Money is about opportunity cost; what else could you do with that money?
[ barter opp cost is much more evident for some opp costs (use the broccoli yourself) ]
People typically fail to consider opportunity costs; it is very difficult to consider opp cost across 1) time and 2) category
[ Shorter horizon == more clear opp cost (e.g., money for a day, for a week, credit cards) ]
Making the opportunity cost specific == better consideration ($1k stereo vs $700 stereo + $300 CDs)
Money is *less valuable* than specific items

# 2.2 Relativity
One trick to think about money, sometimes less effectively: relative vs. absolute terms
Importance of price difference relative to overall price ($8 off $15, $8 off $1015)
Relativity == diminishing returns from money

# 2.3 Pain of payment
Cash feels worse than paying with a credit card
Payment per bite == high unhappiness; closeness to consumption increases pain (+ huge bites, etc.)
Pain of paying adds a "moral tax" to consumption
Time and distance reduce pain

Increase pain by
* use cash
* receive notification when spending (debit card, etc.)
* increase salience (gas vs. electricity)

Decrease pain by
* use credit cards
* hide payments
* prepay before consumption

Gifts remove the pain of payment for the recipient
[ Distance of payment from representation of money -- most pain when bartering? ]

# 2.4 Mental accounting
Idea: money assigned to categories is non-fungible; we assign and spend money based on categories (esp once it is spent, e.g., theater ticket)

Gift certificates are easier to spend than normal money
"Found" money vs. general money
low-interest checking vs. high-interest student loans is another example
mental accounting is a useful heuristic, preventing us from analysis paralysis of full opportunity cost review
Perfect bank account
* assume rational view of money, where it is fungible
* optimize mental acounting techniques (e.g., Simple goals)

# 2.5 Fairness & reciprocity
People pay less for quicker, easier work (vs. long, broken lock)
[ paying for the knowledge of *where* to hit the machine ]
It is *hard* for us to pay for expertise, but it is easy for us to pay for effort (/ incompetence?), under the guise of "fairness"
[ 10x productivity developer? ]
We fail to see marginal costs; our ideas about fairness are based on marginal costs rather than fixed costs
[ ebooks; uber volume pricing ]
Paying for Coke based on external temperature == outrage
Fairness is about *how much it cost to create X vs. how much I pay for X*, not about the *value being purchased*
[ value pricing for salaries ]
Visibility into costs == more willingness to pay
Purchasing decisions *should* be based on weighing pleasure vs. price, but we suck at that
source of good does not change pleasure from it, but it does change how much we are willing to pay

# 2.6 Loss aversion and the endowment effect
We like to make money, but we *hate* to lose money
Losses are about 2.5x worse than gains
Partial taking advantage of company match to 401k is invisible; make it better by pre-paying the company max, then take away undermatching
Endowment effect: we adjust to our level of ownership
ticket owners value tickets > ticket buyers
reasons given for position vary based on situation
free trial == loss aversion
[ take Daisy for the weekend! ]

# 2.7 Market and social norms
Mentioning/adding money changes the situation (date => prostitution)
[ intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation ]
financial motivation >> social motivation (or internal motivation), which leads to bad conclusions
gifts are in the social domain, not market domain
gifts with price tags == market domain
monetary gifts are sometimes socially acceptable, but they do not strengthen relationships
gifts in the workplace move it towards social domain, eliciting more loyalty, etc. (social) from employees
daycare experiment; sometimes-late parents became always-late when fined -- cost offset guilt
once you move to market domain, it is extremely difficult to move back to a social domain
[ is this why I hate companies that move from small => large? ]
complete vs incomplete contracts; complete contracts kill the social domain; general contracts lead to spirit-of-the-law following
specific job descriptions => people just doing those functions

# 2.8 The price of free
People overvalue free (lines at free ice cream day vs. lines at hypothetical free $2.25 day)
Free *hides* external costs
Free works even when it is only part of the product (free book + $20 shipping >>> $20 book + free shipping >>> $10 for each)
works for group dinner payment -- better for even split, better++ one person to pay for the whole thing (multiple benefits)

# 2.9 Micropayments
Possibly bad idea, depending on the case
Fewer payments == less efficient, but much happier
Keeping pricing simple (all one price) makes decisions easier
Consolidating multiple purchases into one notification == lower pain of paying
gift certificates / prepayment also reduce the pain of payment
free apps overwhelm 0.99 apps; better to have 0.05 apps instead of free
