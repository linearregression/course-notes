# The Psychological Consequences of Money
Money makes people feel more self-sufficient, and they behave accordingly.

Experiment 1: people worked longer on hard tasks without asking for help when primed by money concepts
Experiment 2: people worked longer on hard tasks without asking for help when primed by wealth/affluence than they did when primed by poverty; status of the helper did not affect the result.
Experiment 3: people primed with money concepts were less willing to promise to volunteer their time to help others
Experiment 4: people primed with money concepts were less willing to actually help others
Experiment 5: people primed with wealth/affluence were less willing to help others with an unskilled task
Experiment 6: people primed with money concepts donated less to charity
Experiment 7: people primed with money left more physical distance between themselves and others
Experiment 8: people primed with money preferred individual leisure activities to group activities
Experiment 9: people primed with money preferred to work by themselves on other tasks

# Buying Behavior as a Function of ... Number of Choices
Buying behavior as a function of number of choices follows a u-shaped curve.

Experiment: people asked to rate 2-20 (in steps of 2) pens and given the opportunity to buy one; buying followed a u-shaped curve.

# Credit card payments increase unhealthy food purchases
Unhealthy food products are "vice products"; paying with a credit card can reduce pain for such purchases
Impulsive purchases are more likely to be influenced by payment-related pain
Rational choice modeling appears to be inadequate to explaining unhealthy food purchases
Paying with cash is more aversive / painful than paying with non-cash methods, according to past experiments

Cash-paying pain does not appear to affect purchase of virtue products as severely; thus, "the proportion of vice products relative to virtue products in the basket will change depending on the mode of payment"
H1: Vice products will be reduced when paying in cash; virtue products will remain the same.
H2: Credit and debit cards will both reduce pain of payment.
H3: Tightwads will be more vice-regulated by cash payment.

Study 1: real-life shopping data + payment type; support both H1 and H2
Study 2: manipulation of payment method; support H1
Study 3: mediation by pain of payment; support H1; credit card payment reduces pain even when paying attention to prices
Study 4: tightwads vs spendthrifts; support H3

# Opportunity cost neglect
People are bad at assessing opportunity cost, because they fail to spend the time to generate the alternative.

Study 1a: "keep the money for other purposes" can reduce willingness to buy
Study 1b: making cost savings explicit significantly increased purchases of cheaper option
Study 1c: replicated findings with real money and products
Study 2:  segregated amounts; results indicated that only the saved money formulation worked
Study 3:  make people list pros and cons; opportunity cost explicitness increased pros related to being able to purchase other items
Study 4:  priming opportunity costs worked
Study 5:  spendthrifts are more susceptible to opportunity cost neglect when unpromopted; tightwads may be better at realizing opportunity costs
