# The Psychological Consequences of Money
Money makes people feel more self-sufficient, and they behave accordingly.

Experiment 1: people worked longer on hard tasks without asking for help when primed by money concepts
Experiment 2: people worked longer on hard tasks without asking for help when primed by wealth/affluence than they did when primed by poverty; status of the helper did not affect the result.
Experiment 3: people primed with money concepts were less willing to promise to volunteer their time to help others
Experiment 4: people primed with money concepts were less willing to actually help others
Experiment 5: people primed with wealth/affluence were less willing to help others with an unskilled task
Experiment 6: people primed with money concepts donated less to charity
Experiment 7: people primed with money left more physical distance between themselves and others
Experiment 8: people primed with money preferred individual leisure activities to group activities
Experiment 9: people primed with money preferred to work by themselves on other tasks

# Buying Behavior as a Function of ... Number of Choices
Buying behavior as a function of number of choices follows a u-shaped curve.

Experiment: people asked to rate 2-20 (in steps of 2) pens and given the opportunity to buy one; buying followed a u-shaped curve.
