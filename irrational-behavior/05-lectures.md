# Self-control

## Difficulty with self-control
Self-control is about the conflict between *now* and *later*
Diet, exercise, procrastination, texting while driving, unprotected sex.... we recognize that we did something bad, and that we'll *continue* to do the bad thing
Present focus bias: the tendency to give more weight to our current environment or state

Get half of box of chocolates now vs. one week from now; one year from now vs. one year + one week from now -- many more people willing to wait in the latter case
"In the future, we're wonderful people" "Unfortunately, we don't get to live in the future"

Tackled awful interferon medication with movies - reward before the negative effects began
- Liver disease massively discounted by the timeline (30 years out)
- movies were reward substitution
Reward substitution: use an alternate, immediate reward that is more motivating

Global warming is hard to care about
- far in the future
- affects others first
- invisible progression
- no individual suffering
- our behavior has an infinitesimal effect
help for that:
- money
- convenience
- recognition
- appearance
Video games are excellent at reward substitution (leaderboard, etc.)

Priuses look different, and advertise that you're different to others -- signal of eco-friendliness
Prius drivers vs. other hybrid drivers - what else have you done to save energy? No differences; Prius provides a social reward

Reward substitution: your image vs. saving the world

## Reward substitution
Coumadin - effective anti-stroke medication, relatively few side effects, but low compliance
To get to reward substitution:
1. measure something
2. reward / punish based on behavior

Internet-enabled pillboxes allow 1. For 2:
- pay people for taking the pill
- charge people for not taking the pill
- guilt (advertise pill-taking)
- competition
- create obstacles
- cover pills with chocolate

Giving people $3 a day to take their medicine => no effect
Can't give $1k a day, so inflate the effect of the money with *loss aversion*
Pre-paid people for 3 months, then took money away for non-compliance: more effective
Give $100 for compliance over a larger time - problem with future discounting
Give people 10% chance of making $30 a day - people love lotteries, and this is effective

The ideal lottery:
- one big reward
- smaller, more likely rewards

Regret: The comparison between where we are in life and where we could have been (where the latter is better)
Silver medalists smile less than bronze medalists

Regret lottery:
- everyone gets a ticket
- only medicine takers get to collect the winnings, and *tell them when they would have won*
Very successful at encouraging compliance

## Ulysses contracts
Ulysses and the sirens
- hear the sirens and prevent reaction
- turn off the temptation entirely

Self-control contracts:
1. You know you'll be tempted
2. You bind your future self against misbehaving

Pigeons and rats: immediate and delayed reward buttons, always choose immediate reward, even after already having pressed the delayed reward
- third button to disable immediate reward button, they'll push it(!)

We can overcome temptation if we employ the right tools
Naive people: I won't be tempted
Sophisticated: I will be tempted, and I'll take steps to fix it

Clocky: alarm clock that runs away from you
SnuzNLuz - donates money to charities you hate for each snooze button press

Experiment at Panda Express: limit amount of food served for same money (to limit overeating), 1/3 of people did it

## The importance of self-control
Marshmallow experiment
- resistors did better in college

Resistance also correlated with:
- health
- lack of criminal activity
- financial stability

Kids who resisted were able to distract themselves
Is self-control innate or a learned skill? The latter is, at least, more interesting and hopeful

Ego depletion (Baumeister): continual exertion of self-control weakens it (like a muscle)

Religious jews who smoke don't smoke on the Sabbath (?) - some things are outside the options; they don't even think it's possible, so it's not tempting

Our commercial environment tempts us to immediate action, and is always getting better at manipulating us

We have an increasing number of deaths due to bad decisions (10% in 1900, 40% in 2000)
Technology creates chances for us to succumb to temptation (when advanced without regard to self-control issues)

The Denver Drug Program:
- trying to help heroin addicts recover
- wrote a self-incriminating letter to the person they most didn't want to know
- sent the letter if the addict relapsed
- allowed people to opt-out after three week waiting period, to wait out the cravings

"Ulysses contracts must be binding to be effective"
IRBs require subjects to be able to leave at any time, so studying Ulysses contracts is basically impossible

Need to balance human freedom with the controls that will support resisting temptation
