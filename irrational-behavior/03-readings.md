# Contagion and differentiation in unethical behavior
Do visible instances of cheating increase cheating among others?

Possible sources of influence:
1. change estimate of probability of being caught (rational crime theory)
2. change salience of ethicality at moment of potential cheating (fudge factor)
3. change understanding of social norms around dishonesty: descriptive norms vs. injunctive norms

Experiment 1: 
Matrix problems:
- control
- shredder
- in-group cheater
- out-group cheater

predictions of 1: control < shredder < in-group/out-group cheater
predictions of 2: control < in-group/out-group cheater < shredder 
predictions of 3: control < out-group cheater < shredder < in-group cheater **supported**

Experiment 2:
Salience
- control
- shredder
- ask about cheating

predictions of 2: control < ask < shredder **supported**

# Prefrontal white matter in pathological liars
Do pathological liars have different brains?

Identify "liars" by diagnostic criteria
Liars had more white matter and slightly less grey matter

Prefrontal cortex appears to be involved in our ability to lie

# Washing away your sins
Cleansing can be an antidoe to threatened morality

Physical and moral disgust overlap on physiology, psychology, and neurology

Experiment 1:
Does a threat to moral purity prime cleansing words? Yep

Experiment 2: 
Does a threat to moral purity induce a desire to cleanse (increase preference for cleaning products)? 
Primed with selfless or unethical story; participants rated cleansing products more desirable

Experiment 3:
Replicate E2 with actual behavior (taking an antiseptic wipe) - take wipe or pencil, primed with moral threat took the wip

Experiment 4:
Recall unethical deed, then clean hands (or not); cleaners were less motivated to volunteer later and had reduced moral emotions
