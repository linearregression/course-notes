# Contagion and differentiation in unethical behavior
Do visible instances of cheating increase cheating among others?

Possible sources of influence:
1. change estimate of probability of being caught (rational crime theory)
2. change salience of ethicality at moment of potential cheating (fudge factor)
3. change understanding of social norms around dishonesty: descriptive norms vs. injunctive norms

Experiment 1: 
Matrix problems:
- control
- shredder
- in-group cheater
- out-group cheater

predictions of 1: control < shredder < in-group/out-group cheater
predictions of 2: control < in-group/out-group cheater < shredder 
predictions of 3: control < out-group cheater < shredder < in-group cheater **supported**

Experiment 2:
Salience
- control
- shredder
- ask about cheating

predictions of 2: control < ask < shredder **supported**

# Prefrontal white matter in pathological liars
Do pathological liars have different brains?

Identify "liars" by diagnostic criteria
Liars had more white matter and slightly less grey matter

Prefrontal cortex appears to be involved in our ability to lie

# Washing away your sins
Cleansing can be an antidoe to threatened morality

Physical and moral disgust overlap on physiology, psychology, and neurology

Experiment 1:
Does a threat to moral purity prime cleansing words? Yep

Experiment 2:  
Does a threat to moral purity induce a desire to cleanse (increase preference for cleaning products)? 
Primed with selfless or unethical story; participants rated cleansing products more desirable

Experiment 3:
Replicate E2 with actual behavior (taking an antiseptic wipe) - take wipe or pencil, primed with moral threat took the wip

Experiment 4:
Recall unethical deed, then clean hands (or not); cleaners were less motivated to volunteer later and had reduced moral emotions

# Justified ethicality
How much do people lie when they cannot be caught?

Self-justification increases lying, even (especially?) when those justifications are only accessible to the liar

Experiment 1:
Roll a die, earn money according to reported result
Multiple-roll condition had people report the highest result

Experiment 2: 
Ask for what people would report; "justified lies"

Experiment 3:
more asking; more "justified lie" support vs. "dishonest reporting"

Experiment 4:
Is this a lie? Would you do the same? similar results

# The dishonesty of honest people
Fudge factor - self-delusion

Rationale for dishonesty:
- cost-benefit analysis
- internalized norms/values
  - self-concept

Theory of self-concept maintenance:
1. Dishonesty increases as attention to standards for honesty decrease
2. Dishonesty increases as categorization malleability increases
3. Individuals will be dishonest up until the point that they would have to update their self-concept

Experiment 1: 
Increasing salience of honesty ==> more honest **supported**

Experiment 2: 
Increasing salience of honesty through commitment ==> more honest **supported**

Experiment 3:
Increase categorization malleability ==> less honest **supported** (tokens vs. money)

Experiment 4: 
Self-knowledge without self-concept updates; no changes to self-concept despite correct knowledge

Experiment 5:
Level of cheating independent of reported performance of others

Experiment 6:
Likelihood of getting caught => no difference once cheating starts

# Evolution and psychology of self-deception
Self-deception evolved to make deceiving others easier, less costly when discovered, and less costly to maintain
