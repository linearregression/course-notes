# Week 4: Labor and Motivation

## Extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation
naive theory: money is the sole motivator
reality: many things motivate people

standard theory: solely reward-motivated (tangible rewards, specifically)
Ariely thinks that's correct in *certain* circumstances -- sweatshops, etc.
Why do people climb mountains? Professional mountain climbers talk about "pure misery", but they continue to do it over and over
[ proving something to yourself == how I feel about giving myself rhabdo? ]

"People derive value from many different sources"
Story: lots of work, made obsolute at the last possible moment == demotivating
[ graphic.ly redesign ]
"We are motivated to do things that have meaning"

Experiment: building Binocles
build a robot for $3.00, build another for $2.70, etc.
condition 1: meaningful, store the assembled robot
condition 2: Sisyphus, disassemble the robot in front of them
condition 1 results in much more work
condition 2 people had higher "reservation wages"

Experiment: the consultant experiment, predict how much people would work in the Bionicle experiment
People underestimated the difference (1 Bionicle vs. 4 Bionicle)

How does love of Legos connect to number built? positive correlation in meaningful condition, no correlation in Sisyphean condition

## Meaning
Talking to a group of people who'd worked hard for two years and had the project cancelled: massive demotivation
CEO did not appreciate the importance of the *meaning* of their work
Were there **good** ways to cancel the project? Yes; it would have taken time and money, but they would have recognized the meaning of the work.

"Purpose and meaning are so important that they can be worth a substantial investment of time and money"
20% time at Google => make sure people feel valued

## Acknowledgement
Experiment: find paired letters, paid progressively less per sheet
condition 1: write the name, acknowledge on submission
condition 2: no name, ignore submission
condition 3: no name, shred submission
Shredder condition stopped much more quickly than acknowledged condition
Ignored condition == shredder condition

"It's relatively easy to make people feel good about their work"
"Simply ignoring people is almost as demotivating as outright destruction"

Where can we increase meaning and/or stop *decreasing* meaning?

## IKEA effect
Spent a frustrating afternoon assembling a chest, ended up loving it. Labor => love.
Cake mix - just add water vs. require more work
"The egg theory" ==> make things more effortful and have them be valued more highly
[ lesson for Rails here? don't make *all* the decisions? ]

Experiment: origami
How much would (builder|evaluator) pay for the suboptimal origami products?
builders ==> high value, evaluators ==> low value
could builders recognize the self-orientation of the value? Nope -- they thought everyone would value them highly

Experiment: more origami
condition 1: normal instructions
condition 2: harder instructions
condition 2 people valued their products **even more** because of the effort they exerted.

More effort == more love
... as long as *something* results. I.e., no fold/unfold ending in a flat paper that is highly valued

similar to kids - love for our kids vs. other kids? kids are the ultimate IKEA effect
why doesn't everyone love my kids as much as I do?

self-designed clothing, shoes, etc. "Customization is about more than individual preferences. The effort invested also increases liking."

IKEA effect has to be balanced -- too much effort == abandonment

## Not-invented-here bias
IKEA effect => NIH (my idea vs. other people's ideas)
as soon as you say it, you're committed to the idea

Experiment: give NY Times readers big world problems
ask for their own solutions, then rate own solutions vs. ariely's solutions
They rated their own higher
Explanations: 1) their solutions might be better, 2) idiosyncracies, 3) IKEA effect

Experiment: given problem, explain only with provided words
so they're evaluating basically the same ideas, but they still thought their formulations were better. IKEA effect supported

Experiment: given problem and seven words that were scrambled (only one solution)
same result ==> IKEA effect


Edison v Tesla, DC v AC. Edison's idea (DC) vs. outside idea (AC), regardless of objective value of the idea
Toothbrush theory: our toothbrush is way better (== our theory)

NIH Bias:
* Pro: you'll work harder on it
* Con: hinders ability to consider other ideas

[ for BETTER: looking outside for how other people deal with long feedback cycles -- because we don't have ideas of our own yet? ]

Sony is an example of a company too in love with its own ideas, and as a result missed several opportunities

## Cognitive dissonance
Zappos: pay people to leave after training
- retain happy and motivated employees, lose people who aren't happy and motivated ==> better customer service
- cognitive dissonance "the tension that results when there is a mismatch between our beliefs and behaviors"

[ how can I know what I think until I see what I say? ]

Pay people well or poorly for a boring task => poorly-paid would recommend it more highly ("it must be fun, since I kept doing it!")

[ Cialdini - consistency ]

== why playing hard to get could be a good idea (effort forces value -- I wouldn't have worked so hard if the person wasn't worth it)
so, Zappos: reject the money => I must really love Zappos (because I rejected a lot of money)

## Monetary stress and performance
Assumption: no one will work unless they're paid
Even rats will pursue food that requires some labor, even when free food is available (contrafreeloading) - EXCEPT for cats

A bonus is a performance-contingent form of payment
Assumption: bonuses increase effort

Yerkes-Dodson effect: incentive increases performance up to a point, after which it declines
Tested against mice (maze changing daily, electric shock intensity)
"Learning incentives have an inverse-U relationship"

Transfer: as you promise people more of a bonus, people want to perform better, BUT it can backfire (obssessing about the bonus, risk aversion, etc.)
Experiment: in India, gave set of tasks with different bonus schedule (good, very good) based on performance and different bonus amounts (1 day of salary, 2 weeks of salary, 5 months of salary)
Result: highest level of bonus killed performance (middle level sometimes increased, but not always; sometimes decreased (labyrinth)); on combined tests, no difference between low and middle, fall on high

loss aversion: people hate losing more than they love gaining
prepaid in the India experiment; DRAMATICALLY increased stress (second subject ran away with the money instead of paying it back)

real-life bonuses may act like the gain or the loss condition
[ company not hitting goals -- opinion varies from person to person ]
Bankers don't think these results would apply to them, pshaw

Intuition: mechanical vs. mental tasks, how are they differentially affected? No difference in the first experiment (were the tasks purely mechanical?)

Experiment: alternate fingers on a keyboard / matrix test for mechanical / mental task
mechanical task => higher bonus, better performance
mental task => higher bonus, lower performance
=> intuitions about bonuses rely on mechanical tasks, not mental tasks

Bonus/punishment interferes with "flow" state -- bonuses say "I don't think you're motivated enough, so here"

## Social stress and performance
How do social punishments factor in?

Experiment: anagrams, pay for success, occasional solve-anagram-in-front-of-everyone
More important to people -- social desire to look smart / avoid looking foolish
public condition => much lower performance

Higher motivation != better performance

Analysis: how do people play when paired with Tiger Woods (before the troubles)
Results: they stressed out and played worse

Wall St execs still think that they're *special* and immune to stress -- are they in fact immune to big bonuses?
[ does this apply to me, becoming immune to problems that affect large amounts of email at LS? ]

Looked at professional basketball players (thanks, Coach K) -- specifically, "clutch" players
Professional coaches agreed on the categorization; identified clutch players and analyzed performance
Clutch players had more points at end of game than end of half; others had same points at each; BUT clutch players tried more at the end of the game -- same percentage of points. (Despite coaches beliefs, thinking that your percentage actually goes up.)

Analyzed free throws (to avoid variance from defense) - clutch players still have the same free throw %, but only score more because they get more attempts.

## Bonuses, labor, and motivation
People are wrong about basketball (way more selective than Wall St), but we're totally wrong about it wrt our intuitions -- and it's more mechanical than investment banking --- so bankers are probably full of it
Asking bankers -- what do people do in the last quarter? They just talk/think about their bonuses. 

Money is only one aspect of motivation, but it's not always positive.
Small amounts of money can backfire (social relationship => market relationship)
Large amounts can decrease performance by increasing motivation too much
"We do not operate by simple rules of reward"

Motivation is built of many different components
Big bank: how much would a hug, beer, or dinner motivate someone? "We'd never do that"

"We should think of ways to motivate and make people happier besides paying them more."
Particularly for public companies

A thoughtful gift can mean much more than money (NYC apartment for a year vs. big bonus)

Adam Smith v Karl Marx -- efficiency v meaning
complex process == one person per step is more efficient
Smith: work should be specialized
Marx: work has to have meaning, connecting labor to output
pre-Industrial Revolution, Smith was more correct; post-, Marx wins out (esp knowledge economy)
