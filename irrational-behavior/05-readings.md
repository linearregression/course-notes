# Procrastination, deadlines, and performance
Effect of self-imposed deadlines
Self-control problems arise when preferences conflict over time or context (e.g., before, during, and after a meal)

Pilot Study 1:
Class with three papers, students impose deadlines on self
* Optimal: all three papers on the last day
* Result: mean deadline 21.2 days before end of course (32.8 for 1st, 20.4 for 2nd, 10.4 for 3rd)

Pilot Study 2: 
Single paper
Result: 41.59 days before end of course

Study 1:
back to 3 papers
Control: three evenly-spaced deadlines
Result: 41.78 days early for 1st, 26.07 for 2nd, 9.84 for 3rd
Analysis: suboptimal deadline-setting lowered grades compared to control (88.76 for control vs. 85.67 for experiment)
* Final project also saw higher grades from control
* Experimental subject who chose evenly-spaced deadlines performed similarly to control

Study 2:
Are self-imposed (suboptimal) deadlines better than maximum-flexibility?
Supported

# Personal decisions are the leading cause of death
Personal decisions (e.g., smoking, drinking, overeating) cause >1M deaths annually, up from much smaller numbers in 1900 and 1950

personal decision == choice among 2 or more alternatives
readily available alternative == would have known about / could have chosen without investing substantial time or money
premature deah == dying sooner than one would have had another choice been taken

~5% of deaths in 1900 => personal decisions
~22% of deaths in 1950
~44.5% of deaths today
