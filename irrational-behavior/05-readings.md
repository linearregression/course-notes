# Procrastination, deadlines, and performance
Effect of self-imposed deadlines
Self-control problems arise when preferences conflict over time or context (e.g., before, during, and after a meal)

Pilot Study 1:
Class with three papers, students impose deadlines on self
* Optimal: all three papers on the last day
* Result: mean deadline 21.2 days before end of course (32.8 for 1st, 20.4 for 2nd, 10.4 for 3rd)

Pilot Study 2: 
Single paper
Result: 41.59 days before end of course

Study 1:
back to 3 papers
Control: three evenly-spaced deadlines
Result: 41.78 days early for 1st, 26.07 for 2nd, 9.84 for 3rd
Analysis: suboptimal deadline-setting lowered grades compared to control (88.76 for control vs. 85.67 for experiment)
* Final project also saw higher grades from control
* Experimental subject who chose evenly-spaced deadlines performed similarly to control

Study 2:
Are self-imposed (suboptimal) deadlines better than maximum-flexibility?
Supported

# Personal decisions are the leading cause of death
Personal decisions (e.g., smoking, drinking, overeating) cause >1M deaths annually, up from much smaller numbers in 1900 and 1950

personal decision == choice among 2 or more alternatives
readily available alternative == would have known about / could have chosen without investing substantial time or money
premature deah == dying sooner than one would have had another choice been taken

~5% of deaths in 1900 => personal decisions
~22% of deaths in 1950
~44.5% of deaths today

# Save more tomorrow
SMT increases participation, tenure, and contribution
pensions, social security, and home equity = low willpower savings
Do workers want to save more? Yes, SMT proves it (binding)
Normative analysis: rational choice
Descriptive analysis: departures from normativity
Prescriptive analysis: advice to get closer to normativity

problems:
* education
* self-control
* procrastination

procrastination as time discounting (now is more important than later)

automatic enrollment plans win big (49% participation => 86% or more)
- but people don't do more than the default

SMT takes advantage of time discounting (sure, I want to save more in the future), bounded rationality (simple), procrastination/inertia (auto-enrollment), and loss aversion (don't take away something people already have)

SMT:
1. asked to join well before a raise
2. savings increased after raises
3. each raise increases savings (up to max)
4. employees can opt out

1998 / mid-sized manufacturing
- investment consultant
- override software suggestion (use it for 5%, otherwise cap at 5%)
- participation very low for consultant plan; high (78%) adopted SMT afterwards
- no reduction in saving rate even after (a few) people dropped out
- selection bias? probably not, since the SMT plan people were the worst savers before

2001 / Ispat Inland
- only one raise so far
- letter from HR & Union inviting people to join SMT
- decent uptake among 401k and non-401k members (lower for the latter)

2002 / Philips Electronics
- invitation letters to Divisions A and O
- 40% of A attended seminar; 60% of O (were told it was required) and had the chance to meet 1-1 with a financial planner
- savings increases not tied to pay raises
- employees could pick rate of increase
- low dropout
- A had 16.9% join, O had 38.3% 

SMT appears to induce great, but not "too high" levels of saving

Libertarian paternalism

# Gradient of childhood self-control
Effects of self-control (as demonstrated during childhood) over 32 years of life

Tasks measured:
* delay of gratification
* time discounting
* intertemporal choice tasks

Outcomes measured:
* wealth
* criminal behavior
* health

high retention in the longitudinal study (92% at 32 years)

Predicting health: 
* supported (child self-control predicted adult health)
* no for depression, yes for substance dependence

wealth: 
* one-parent v two-parent households
* less planful (savings, home ownership, etc.)
* money management difficulties

crime:
* supported

gradient: 
* supported
* changes over time had positive effects (i.e., kids who got better at self-control had better outcomes later)

adolescent snares as the mechanism for later outcomes? -- contributed, but self-control still had clear effects on outcomes (even among no-snare people)

predictable by age 3

siblings show same effects (low self-control => worse outcomes)

[ OK, how do you improve someone's self-control? ]
