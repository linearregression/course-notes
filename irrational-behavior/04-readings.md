# Effort for payment
Monetary vs. social markets and their responsiveness to financial compensation
Focusing on situations where payment is independent of effort

Fiske's relational theory
Four types of relationships:
1. Communal sharing
2. Authority ranking
3. Equality matching
4. Market pricing (monetary market, vs. all others being social markets)

Theory: relationship between payment and effort will vary based on market type.
Monetary markets will see effort directly related to compensation
Social markets will see effort not at all related to compensation (and always high)
No-payment effort may be higher than low-payment effort
Monetary payments will overwhelm social signals

Experiment: survey asking people to predict effort in return for various sorts of payment
All hypotheses supported

Experiment: drag a ball around a computer screen for varying payment
All hypotheses supported

Experiment: monetize the candy payment, do arithmetic
All hypotheses supported

# Feeling good about giving
Does charity make you happy? Can pointing that out reduce charitable behavior?

Happier people give more (Isen and Levin, Aderman); unhappier people give less (Aderman), etc.
fMRI evidence indicates that charity activates the "reward" part of the brain
Appears to be a positive feedback loop here

OK, how about informing people of this link? Will it swamp the intrinsic motiviations?
Matching donations increases giving (though not in the long run, where it depresses giving); sending gifts may suppress donation size
Survey of NY Times readers appears that education *does not* depress the effect (giving => happiness)

Evidence is still unclear as to whether charities should advertise the research that giving will make you happier.
