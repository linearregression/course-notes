# Effort for payment
Monetary vs. social markets and their responsiveness to financial compensation
Focusing on situations where payment is independent of effort

Fiske's relational theory
Four types of relationships:
1. Communal sharing
2. Authority ranking
3. Equality matching
4. Market pricing (monetary market, vs. all others being social markets)

Theory: relationship between payment and effort will vary based on market type.
Monetary markets will see effort directly related to compensation
Social markets will see effort not at all related to compensation (and always high)
No-payment effort may be higher than low-payment effort
Monetary payments will overwhelm social signals

Experiment: survey asking people to predict effort in return for various sorts of payment
All hypotheses supported

Experiment: drag a ball around a computer screen for varying payment
All hypotheses supported

Experiment: monetize the candy payment, do arithmetic
All hypotheses supported

# Feeling good about giving
Does charity make you happy? Can pointing that out reduce charitable behavior?

Happier people give more (Isen and Levin, Aderman); unhappier people give less (Aderman), etc.
fMRI evidence indicates that charity activates the "reward" part of the brain
Appears to be a positive feedback loop here

OK, how about informing people of this link? Will it swamp the intrinsic motiviations?
Matching donations increases giving (though not in the long run, where it depresses giving); sending gifts may suppress donation size
Survey of NY Times readers appears that education *does not* depress the effect (giving => happiness)

Evidence is still unclear as to whether charities should advertise the research that giving will make you happier.

# A fine is a price
Day care center study!

Will fining parents for lateness decrease their lateness?
Deterrence theory says yes

Incomplete contracts can be swayed to financial vs. social by fines
Adding the fine doubled late-arriving parents, and removing it didn't return things to the original levels

Perfectly-rational models don't match this behavior

# Man's search for meaning
Bionicle experiment

Less meaningful work == higher reservation wages
Labor is meaningful to the extent that 1) it is recognized and/or 2) has some point or purpose.

Experiment: find paired letters, paid per page (progressively less)
condition 1: acknowledged
condition 2: ignored
condition 3: shredded
Results: opposite of standard theory; effort highest in acknowledged and the same in ignored/shredded

Experiment: Bionicle assembly
condition 1: new bionicle each time
condition 2: cycle through two bionicles (Sisyphus)
Results: meaningful condition built 3.4 more bionicles
Sisyphus participants "became disenchanted with their work"

Marx's alienation of labor - worker separated from own activities, goals of the labor, and process of production

# The IKEA effect
Effort increases the value placed on the product by the worker
[ Labroo and Kim, 2009 - "becoming a nicer person"? ]
Success is required for overvaluing to occur
People have a need for efficacy -- completion of tasks helps people feel competent and in control, and failure has negative psychological consequences

Experiments: IKEA boxes, origami, and Lego construction

Additional data: endowment effect and touch effect -- both less than IKEA
completion is required for overvaluing (half-built boxes)
not just DIYers susceptible to the effect

[ involve users/consumers in effort to make them value the product more highly ]

impact on sunk-cost and not-invented-here syndrome

# Large stakes and big mistakes
Excessive rewards => worse performance (India experiment)

Automated vs. conscious tasks, bonuses run the risk of de-automating the task
Bonuses can split attention

Experiment: six games, all adversely affected by the highest reward
Experiment: adding vs. key pressing - key pressing got faster with higher incentives, opposite for adding (matrix)
Experiment: social incentives (audience effect), anagrams - audience depressed success
