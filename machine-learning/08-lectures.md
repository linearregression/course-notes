# Non-linear hypotheses
Neural networks!
Alternative to linear and logistic regression

Example: 
* non-linear classification, avoiding massively polynomial equations (or situations with many features)
* computer vision

# Neurons and the brain
Attempts to mimic the brain - popular from the 80s to the mid-90s, before fading in the late 90s (but coming back now)
Computationally expensive, but modern neural networks run well
Evidence for "one learning algorithm": neural plasticity / rewiring
