# Introduction
Machine learning is becoming ubiquitous
Grew out of AI; couldn't program complex tasks, so program the machine to learn how to program itself

Current uses:
* data mining (clickstream, medical records, etc.)
* highly-complex/difficult programs (NLP, handwriting, vision, etc.)
* self-customizing programs (recommendations, etc.)
* research on human learning
