# Applying ML
How do you choose which algorithm / model to apply?

Debugging a learning algo:
* on testing, you find huge errors with your existing hypothesis - what next?
  * more training examples
  * try fewer features
  * try more features
  * try polynomial features
  * increase or decrease lambda

Diagnostic: a test you can run to find out what is and isn't working with a given algo
