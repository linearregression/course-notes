# Reasons for defects
Quality: performance and conformance (meeting customer needs and meeting expected standards)

Probability of defects compound over # of steps
yield = % of good units produced; can be measured at a single step or for the whole process

Redundancy (Swiss cheese model) decreases defect rates, but can't eliminate it entirely -- ALL things have to go wrong to end with a faulty unit (compared to assembly line, where ANY step can go wrong and spoil the output)

# Quality and flow
Defect rates can change locations of bottlenecks (e.g., high defect rate means that you'll get less correct production out of a step); changes demand for later in the flow (50% rate at step 2 means you need 2D input to get D input for step 3)

Scrap vs. rework -- scrap means all prior steps suffer from defects; rework means only the current step is affected
* Calculate correct expected processing time
* or calculate implied utilization by dividing demand by capacity

Cost of defects:
* before bottleneck = driven by the input costs 
* after bottleneck = opportunity costs of missing the sale

resource starving vs. resource blocking - buffer or suffer!
Inventory protects from variability regardless of variability source (demand or quality)
Toyota system: reduce inventory to expose problems (so they can be fixed)

Kanban: work is authorized by demand, so inventory is controllable

# Six Sigma
What about non-binary quality issues?
LSL = lower specification limit
USL = upper specification limit

Capability score (Cp score) = (USL - LSL) / (6 * stdev)
Improve Cp score == higher quality
parts per million = defect rate * 1M units, standard expression for quality targets
with this, you can calculate the allowable stdev for any desired quality goal
