# Reasons for variety
Fit-based variety - each customer has a unique point of maximal utility, distance from that point decreases utility (horizontal differentiation) (t-shirts)
Performance-based variety - each customer prefers high performance, but differ in how they value quality vs. price (computers)
Taste-based variety - customers differ in taste and over time (food, music, art)

Variety because:
* heterogeneous preferences
* price discrimination
* variety-seeking
* avoiding price competition
* channel shelf space
* niche saturation

# Capacity calculations
Setup / switchover costs lower capacity
Ex: custom shirts sold online; infinitely many sizes, many styles and colors, four weeks lead time, minimum order of 5 shirts
Production process: cutting (constant setup time); sewing (sewing + assembly); finishing

Capacity given a batch size = batch size / (setup time + batch size * time per unit (processing time))
Compare to individual capacity: number of workers / processing time

Large batches are a form of economy of scale - minimize impact of setup time; cap as function of batch size asymptotically approaches individual cap

Large batches lead to higher inventory

# Mixed model production

# Choosing a batch size

# Demand fragmentation and pooling
 
# Flexibility

# Platforms and modularity

# Limits to customer choice
