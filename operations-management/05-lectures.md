Fit-based variety - each customer has a unique point of maximal utility, distance from that point decreases utility (horizontal differentiation) (t-shirts)
Performance-based variety - each customer prefers high performance, but differ in how they value quality vs. price (computers)
Taste-based variety - customers differ in taste and over time (food, music, art)

Variety because:
* heterogeneous preferences
* price discrimination
* variety-seeking
* avoiding price competition
* channel shelf space
* niche saturation
