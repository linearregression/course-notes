# Intro to productivity
Teddy Roosevelt FTW

Productivity = units of output / input used
Multifactor productivity = output / (capital $ + labor $ + materials $ + service $ + energy $)
Waste and inefficiencies reduce productivity (beyond natural limits == e.g., no more than 60 minutes of work in an hour for a worker)
* distance from the efficient frontier

Tradeoff between responsiveness and productivity

# The seven sources of waste
Lean operations and waste
Sources of waste:

Resource-focused
1. Overproduction (wasted food after buying in bulk) => improve supply-demand match
2. Transportation (moving product around) => relocate processes, standardize transport
3. Rework (readmissions to ICU) => analyze and solve causes of rework
4. Over-processing (staying in the hospital after you're better) => provide clear, customer-driven standards for processes
5. Motion (ergonomics) => arrange people and parts to minimize unneeded motion

Flow-unit-focused
6. Inventory (loan applications backlog) => improve production control system and reduce unnecessary buffer
7. Waiting (ER waiting rooms) => understand the drivers of waiting

Minimizing waste can dramatically affect a business (Totota methods vs. GM methods in 1986)

"Moving is not necessarily working"

*8.* Intellectual waste - not taking full advantage of workers' minds

# Financial value of productivity
Finance / operations disconnect
Always be thinking of the end result (e.g., profit) and the impact of operational changes on it -- don't just optimize productivity for the sake of optimizing it

# KPI




# Overall equipment effectiveness




# Takt time





# Quartile analysis





# Productivity ratios
