# What is myth?
What is it to be human?
Myth is a tool to try to explain the world
- can operate as a "container" for things considered valuable in a culture

Conflicts in definitions of myths:
1. Myths are (untrue | profoundly true)
2. Myths expose (universal truths | specific, cultural truths)
3. Myths are (historical, primitive, obsolete | forever true)

Mythos - Greek definitions over time
1. Speech
2. Narrative story
3. False narrative story
4. False story with underlying truth

# Course overview
Representations of Hercules (Sorbo, image, statue, Roman statue, Greek statue / Herakles, etc.)
Myths are stories that are constantly retold; searching for the "original" version is an endless diversion

Topics in the myths we'll see:
* human
* animals
* hybrids
* gods
* monsters
* the sea

# Ancient ideas on myth
Varied ideas about myth in antiquity 
* censorship - indeceny is not permitted
* myth constructs culture (Plato) - indecency could create indecent culture
[ violent video games today ]
* culture constructs myth (Xenophanes) - gods look like their worshippers. coincidence? I think not
* allegory (Metrodorus, etc.) - gods aren't *actually* personified entities; they're allegories for deep truths / elements of the cosmos / body
* literary / anti-allegorical (Aristarchus) - stay in the world of the story, consider only within that framework
* Euhemerism (Euhemerus) - historical sources
[ Herakles as a name for a hero of Hera? ]

Euhemerism and allegory survive best

# Ideas on myth from the modern era
Renaissance and forward
Euhemerism and allergory remain the strongest contenders
Myths as fabulae (story, tale, tall tale) -- not much on the deep meaning front

de Fontenelle (~1700) - myths were reactions to the natural environment; attempts to explain strange features of the world
- myths as bad science

Hume - "impatience with the mythic mind", myths were obsoleted by rationalism and science

Heyne - precursor to classics, understanding myth in context and as part of the context
- myths as expression of awe at the natural world (not just fear)
- introduced mythos / myth as the term for these stories (vs. fabulae)
- needed concrete terms to represent abstract concepts

Herder - early Romanticist, myths express profound, deep truths, and were innate
- myth == poetry, religion, etc.

Burkert - standard definition of myth for this course
"traditional tale, told with secondary, partial reference to something of collective importance", "told by someone for some reason" (addition by Struck)

# The Trojan war and the world of Homer
Trojan War: 13th century BCE
Homer: 8th century BCE
Athens: 5th century BCE
Rome: 1st century BCE

Schleimann (~1850) - discoverer of Troy's ruins, dated to 13th c BCE
The Homeric epics don't map to any current genre (cold war, etc.)

Iliad
* Achilles
* Agamemnon
* Ajax
* Diomedes
* Hector
* Paris
* Priam

The Iliad is a poem about rage (*starts* with rage), specifically about Achilles' conflict with Agamemnon (never resolved); Achilles reconciles(?) with Priam
The Iliad deals with *three days* of the ten-year war; other details come from other epic poems, including the backstory (Paris/Helen/Menelaus; apple of discord)

# Trojan war aftermath and the Homer question
Similar energy spent by poets on the aftermath of the Trojan War
Odysseus, Diomedes, and the Palladium
Surviving Greek stories don't attempt to absolve responsibility -- no "it was war, so it was reasonable"
Nostoi: journeys home - dealing with the negativity stirred up by the War on the way home => The Odyssey

Homer (750 BCE)
Current thinking: there was a single Homer, due to the coherence of the stories (or maybe a couple of Homers - one per poem)

writing: Cretan Linear Script > Greek alphabet
wrote in dactylic hexameter
* six feet per line
* - u u / - u u / - u u / - u u / - u u / - x

# On reading Homer
The Odyssey's first 10 lines
Starts with "Man"
Commands the Muse to sing to him (Homer) of a man -- divinely inspired
Odysseus is resourceful (man of twists and turns), constantly driven off course after the War
He sees many cities, learns many things about people
He suffers immensely, and fights for survival (his own and his companions) with limited success
His companions brought their own fate down upon them -- recklessly (devouring Helios' cattle)
