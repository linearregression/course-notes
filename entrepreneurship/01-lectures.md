# Entrepreneurial mindset
Entrepreneurs come before entrepreneurship - everything flows from the people
So, who are these people? What and how do they think? etc.

Mindset:
* Achievement
  Defined as a preference for challenge, acceptance of responsibility

* Individualism
  Willingness/preference to defy the norm

* Control
  Belief in a personal, internal locus of control (I can influence outcomes, vs. the world controls outcomes)

* Focus
  Attention + commitment
  improve focus by setting SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound / significant, meaningful, action-oriented, rewarding, trackable)

* Optimism
  Make judgements on subjective positive factors; tend to discount uncertainty and overlook critical elements when extreme
  Strive for objective evaluation to moderate optimism; interview users to validate belief and challenge assumptions
