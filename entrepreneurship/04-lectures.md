# Industry understanding - environmental assessment
Competitive advantage - make it less attractive for others to enter the space

Environmental scanning
General, industrial, and competitive environment
Regulatory environment affects smaller ventures in multiple ways
* what is the structure of the industry? how likely is it to evolve over time?

Five competitive forces that determine profitability:
1. Industry competitors (rivals)
2. Buyers
3. Suppliers
4. Potential entrants
5. Substitutes

## Rivals
Industry growth, fixed costs, product differences, brand identity, switching costs

## Buyers
Bargaining leverage - concentration, volume, switching costs, info, etc.
Price sensitivity 

## Suppliers
Differentiation of inputs, switching costs, substitues, concentration, volume, cost, impact on cost/differentiation

## Potential entrants
Entry barriers - economy of scale, capital requirements, etc.

## Substitutes
Airlines vs. trains - not direct competitors
Similar concerns to rivals

# Selecting the right industry
Evaluate new-firm success rate in the industry;
Look for dying businesses and avoid them (pay phones, arcades)
Look for growing demo trends

Knowledge conditions - how much knowledge is required to enter? specific expertise?
Demand conditions - how many customers, growing or not, what do they want (hetero/homogenuous); segmentation 
Industry life cycle - stage of development; customer adoption; young industries easier to enter
Industry structure - some industries intrinsically friendlier to new entrants

# Types of innovation
Innovation: "the act of introducing something new" [ meh, dictionary definitions ]
Our definition: commercializable improvement

Multiple degrees: 
* basic design concepts REINFORCED or OVERTURNED
* linkages between modules UNCHANGED or CHANGED

R/U = incremental
O/U = component innovation
R/C = architectural innovation
O/C = disruptive innovation

Product innovations: new products that give signficant improvement
Service innovations
Process innovations
Business model innovations
Supply chain innovations
Marketing innovations
Organizational innovations

# Strategic positioning
Strategy: company position; tradeoffs; forging fit

Position
* serve few needs of many customers
* serve broad needs of few customers

Tradeoffs: you cannot be all things to all people. Serve one market well before growing

Forging a git among company activities; coherence

Strategic position should help you discover new opportunities
