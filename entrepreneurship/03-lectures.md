# Exploring real market needs
A successful company must satisfy customer needs (better than competitors) at a price that covers the creation and delivery of that solution

Key questions:
* is there an unsolved problem?
* is there a better way to solve it?
* can you introduce a sustainably better price?

Pain and aggravation are good markers for potential needs, as are unfulfilled wishes

Customer prefreences can be gathered from:
* online reviews
* focus groups
* forecast trends
* etc

Avoid attempting to satisfy every need (Homer's car)
Necessities vs. preferences
Don't oversegment (for multiple products)

# Satisfying real market needs
Questions
1. why do customers need this?
2. how should I best assess their needs?
3. what features should I provide?
4. why is this better than competitors?
5. what price should I charge?

Don't overdesign the product -- easiest, cheapest thing that solves the need
Keep production costs low

Tesla vs. Chevy Volt vs. GEM - different niches, different markets, different prices
Be honest about product placement in the competitive landscape

Use social network to gather competitive intelligence
Ask for feedback

Marketing is important
Understand:
* personal selling
* pricing

Make sure to determine the fixed, variable, and hidden costs
Beware under-pricing

Customer and product availability
Growth options

Ventures fail because:

Competitive advantage

Questions about the market
* size, penetrability, demographics, etc.
