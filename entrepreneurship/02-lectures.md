# Entrepreneurial motivations and behaviors
Self-efficacy = belief that you can accomplish a *specific* task
Cognitive motivation = needing/liking research vs. intuition (experience, etc.)
Tolerance for ambiguity = tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable rather than threatening

Biases
* Overconfidence - overly optimistic; valuable in persuasion; explains high failure rates
* Representativeness - sampling bias/stereotyping; inaccurate perceptions of reality
* Counterfactual thinking - what might have been; regret; FOMO leading to pursuing mediocre opportunities

Behavior results from
* confidence - may require going against norms; self-doubt can lead to external doubt
* interpersonal relationship skills - likeability and communication; influences connections and networking
* social capital - founded by relationship skills; resources you know and who they know; richness depends on size, quality, and diversity; leads to better information, creativity, efficiency, problem solving, etc.
* risk tolerance - willingness (not desire) to accept risk

# Biases and heuristics
Entrepreneurs use heuristics because they
* work with incomplete data
* need to make faster/cheaper decisions
* need to take decisive action

LEARN-ideas-BUILD-code-MEASURE-data-> loop

Dangers:
* hasty decisions
* incomplete analysis
* squander resources
* new biases

Representativeness - decision-making based on too-small dataset
Overconfidence - overly optimistic => too slow to change course

Managing the biases
* actively seek information
* define assumptions
* consider alternatives
* estimate consequences
* work as a team
* solicit advice

Customer discovery => validation => company creation => company building

# Risk taking
Entrepreneurs don't desire more risk; they perceive risk differently
Example: Tesla, SpaceX

Strategic decisions are inherently risky

Why engage in risk?
* insufficient information
* develop an inside view of the decisions faced
* ignore elements of past decisions
* expect favorable outcomes

Why accept risk?
* how high are the risks?
* what are the rewards?
* what are the consequences?
* were all complex decisions factored in?

More dynamic industries lead to more risk-taking

Assessing real risk
* apply multiple perspectives
* integrate multiple perspectives
* use complex cognitive framework (data, others)
