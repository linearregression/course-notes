# Who is producing comic book culture?

Reading Ms. Marvel / Captain Marvel / Daredevil

## 301 Cultural producers?
Story creators, etc. are symbol creators -- and in comics, they're overwhelmingly male

[ what about the non-superhero -- specifically romance -- comics? ]

Wertham, Comics Code Authority, etc.
Batman's (one of) the most masculine of all characters - contrast his depiction with those of his rogues - despite the oft-inferred underlying homosexuality of his relationship with Robin (thanks, Wertham!)

Robert Crumb in the 60s; underground comics addressing feminism and other topics that didn't appear in the mainstream

Mainstream comics don't have the same flexibility wrt culture as indies, due to their corporate ownership

## 302 Groups and individuals
Mort Weisinger, editor of Superman family titles in 50s and 60s. Exerted extreme control over hundreds of Superman comics a year, introducing tons of gimmicks and cultural issues -- Kandor, Phantom Zone, baldness & obesity as major problems. He used Superman as wish fulfillment.

Lois suffered greatly under Mort, exhibiting his own attitudes towards women. Part of the cultural transfer came from the Superman TV series, where the second season was less assertive, more submissive, more "feminine". Attitudes towards women were getting regressive, reacting to increasing presence of women outside the home, etc.

Post-Mort, second wave of feminism: Lois flourished, but became more sexualized as well.

Direct effects theory: media contains messages that are passively absorbed by the audience
Active audience theory: audience interprets messageing (polysemy)

Wonder Woman in the 70s, powerless -- intended to empower women, seen as anti-feminist

[ why would you assume that the creators' intended mesage is the predominant one? ]

Encoding/decoding theory: media provides messages, audiences can interpret those in multiple ways
Decoding:
1. preferred reading (agree with "intended" message)
2. oppositional reading (reject intended message)
3. negotiated reading (partial acceptance / partial rejection)

Oversexualized women in comics -- preferred reading is "no harm intended"; oppositional is "sexism/offensive"; negotiated is "sexist + honest reflection of what men want to see"

## 303 Gender and pop culture
Pop culture as escape?

Does the overwhelmingly-male population of culture producers matter? Probably

Look at the critics' reviews of The Avengers and their discussion (or lack thereof) around Black Widow

## 304 Readings
Ms. Marvel (1977) - super-revealing costume, assertive in secret identity (with J Jonah!)

Ms. Marvel (2006) - hypersexualized, very different

Captain Marvel (2012) - conscious costume redesign to avoid oversexualization; much more realistic characterization. Massive uproar over giving her pants!

Daredevil (2011) - hypermasculine characterization; few womwn in the book
