# Spice World: Constructing Feminity the Popular Way
Premise: the Spice Girls provide a variety of potential avenues to express femininity

Baby (Emma): childish and cute
Sexy (Geri): provocative, sexual
Scary (Mel B): rule breaker, independent
Sporty (Mel C): fit, athletic, girl next door
Posh (Victoria): elegant, aristocratic

Appearance is used as the key signifier of behavior and self-concept.

Sisterhood is a driving theme
Sexuality is complex
Motherhood is negative?
Race - Mel B as the "wild, untamed" one is a challenge and potentially harmful, remedied a bit by toning that aspect down later in the group's lifecycle
