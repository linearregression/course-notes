# Doing Gender
Decades ago, sex and gender *seemed* relatively straightforwardly distinct
Ongoing research showed a more complicated picture
Goal of the article: show that gender is "a routine, methodical, and recurring accomplishment"
Defining sex (biologically determined), sex category (displayed identification with a sex), and gender (activity of managing conduct for one's sex category): female sex organs => wearing a dress => gendered female

role theory is mistaken, as gender roles are not specifically situational (unlike, say "nurse," "student," etc.)

## Gender display
Goffman: Interactional portrayals of what we would like to convey about our sexual natures
Problem: gender isn't just something we choose to display

We assume sex == sex category => we deduce sex from sex category

Actions are often considered as accountable -- how they will be characterized when observed
"If sex category is omnirelevant ... virtually any activity can be assessed as to its womanly or manly nature."
We cannot avoid "doing" gender

## Recruitment to gender identities
Children are concerned with distinguishing between themselves and others based on behavior (baby vs. big boy/big girl)
Boys learn to value "efficaciousness", girls to value "appearance"
