# Intro to M1
Starting with gender, getting to comics later
[ grr comixology product placement ]

# W101: What is gender?
Cultures determine gender -- example culture with five
Expectations color perception
Gender is a performance

# W102: Gender stereotypes, roles, and identities
Stereotypes are pervasive, reinforced by media
[ can you use sterotypes to subvert themselves? ]
current gender stereotypes basically stem from the victorian, post-industrial age

Gender roles are what is "considered appropriate" for males and females; vary based on culture
"nurse == female"
Again, distributed and perpetuated by media

Gender identity => personal sense of your own gender
cisgender == gender "appropriate" for sex
transgender == gender "not appropriate" for sex

Comics and gender
Comics are media, so they influence stereotypes and gender roles
* Fantastic Four in the 60s - Sue Storm, invisible, wants feminine things, does domestic, team-building things
* Wonder Woman joined the JL and assumed the role of the secretary
* Jean Loring chose career over Ray Palmer
* Superman (masculine) vs. Clark Kent (un-masculine, weak)

# W103 Culture or biology?
Essentialist vs. social constructionist

Gender identity in comics -- lots of opportunity to experiment with transgender (shapeshifting, body jumping, etc.)

# Discussion on readings
Strangers in Paradise -- not drawn for male gaze OR female gaze
lots of stereotype-flipping

Rachel Rising; Jet is surprisingly a woman (I missed that)

Wonder Woman - strong female character or eye candy?
[ totally depends on the writer, no? ]
[ no mention of Marston's unusual fetishes? ]
