# 1.1 Visual and Decision Illusions
## Pain: Ariely's background

1. Longer, milder pain is better than shorter, intense pain
2. More-less is a better progression than less-more
3. Recuperation time helps

IRRATIONALITY: We think we know how things work, but we're wrong

## Visual illusions
Context affects decisions (color perception, anchoring, etc.)
Invisible gorilla illusion
Expectations color perception

If we're so good at vision and screw up there, why wouldn't you expect similar errors in domains that we're not as good at.

# 1.2 Defaults
Organ donation

Choice architecture - choices are influenced by external factors:
* environment
* defaults
* complexity

People make up explanations for their behavior, even when it's a simple as "I stuck with the default" - thus, focus groups / any self-report of behavior is suspect.

Patients who start on branded medication don't switch to generics, even in the face of substantial marketing and savings

Choice inertia - fix it by FORCED CHOICE

Defaults become more powerful as complexity increases

# 1.3 Preferences, self-knowledge
When we don't know what we want, we use the environment (priming, social proof, consistency etc.)
Re: consistency -- if it's hard to come up with 10 reasons you love someone, you discount your love (compare to how easy it is to come up with 3 reasons)

# 1.4 Choice sets and relativity
Anchoring - flossing per day or per month with the same number scale, gives temporary mindset as to quality of dental hygiene, can affect behavior
Choice set => mindset => short term effect => long term effect

Adding undesirable option (Rome v Paris v Rome-) makes choice predictable - decoy effect, asymmetric dominance
Happens when we're not sure how to evaluate the options

Inflation - lion seals, school choice, etc. Pushing past optimal because of local context.
