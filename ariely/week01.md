## Pain: Ariely's background

1. Longer, milder pain is better than shorter, intense pain
2. More-less is a better progression than less-more
3. Recuperation time helps

IRRATIONALITY: We think we know how things work, but we're wrong

Invisible gorilla illusion

* defaults
* complexity

Patients who start on branded medication don't switch to generics, even in the face of substantial marketing and savings

Choice inertia - fix it by FORCED CHOICE

Defaults become more powerful as complexity increases
